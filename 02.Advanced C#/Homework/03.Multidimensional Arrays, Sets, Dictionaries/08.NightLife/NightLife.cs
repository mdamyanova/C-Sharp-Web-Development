//Being a nerd means writing programs about night clubs instead of 
//actually going to ones. Spiro is a nerd and he decided to summarize 
//some info about the most popular night clubs around the world. 
//He's come up with the following structure â€“ he'll summarize the data 
//by city, where each city will have a list of venues and each venue 
//will have a list of performers. Help him finish the program, so he can 
//stop staring at the computer screen and go get himself a cold beer.
//You'll receive the input from the console. There will be an arbitrary 
//number of lines until you receive the string "END". Each line will 
//contain data in format: "city;venue;performer". If either city, venue or 
//performer don't exist yet in the database, add them. If either the city 
//and/or venue already exist, update their info.
//Cities should remain in the order in which they were added, venues should 
//be sorted alphabetically and performers should be unique (per venue) and 
//also sorted alphabetically.
//Print the data by listing the cities and for each city its venues 
//(on a new line starting with "->") and performers (separated by comma and space).
