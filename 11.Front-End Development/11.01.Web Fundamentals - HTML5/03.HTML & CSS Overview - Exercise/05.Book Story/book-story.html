<h1>The story in the Book</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p> Molly had been starting out of her window for about an hour now.On deck,lying between the copies of <em>Nature</em>,<em>New Scientist</em>,and all the other sceentific jornals her work had appeared in,was a well thumbed copy of <em>On The Road.</em>I had been Mollys favourite book since college,and the longer she spent in these four ealls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
    <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room,sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>.</p>
